00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.300


00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.550
DIANE DALLIS-COMENTALE: Hello.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.050
OK.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.710
Just checking.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.310
Welcome everyone.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.050
Good afternoon.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.390
I'm Diane Dallis-Comentale,
Ruth Lilly Dean of IU Libraries.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.550
Indiana University
has championed

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.280
libraries and archives
of diverse collections

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.290
which have been
developed over centuries

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.840
by expert librarians,
researchers, archivists,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.070
and curators.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.440
As a librarian, I
have the privilege

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.480
of leading one of the
top research library

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.680
systems in North America.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.940
My role requires me to
simultaneously consider

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.000
the past and the future, and
constantly keep those things

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.350
in the balance.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.050
I ask that we pause
for a moment to think

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.300
about all that has
come before us,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.660
and all those who made it
possible for us to be here,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.190
together, today.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.370
Indiana University was built
on Indigenous homelands

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.450
and resources.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.550
With deep respect
and appreciation,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.340
I acknowledge the Indigenous
nations' communities, families,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.780
and especially those of the
Miami, Delaware, Potawatomi,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.340
and Shawnee people.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.830
The Foundation of our
state and our University

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.280
was built on unceded land
by indentured laborers,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.670
immigrants, and many people
who endured and struggled

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.820
those whose names
and lives have often

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.160
been forgotten by history.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.640
With this in mind, before
our program starts,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.400
I hope that you consider the
opportunity and privilege we

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.050
all share in being here today.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.770
All who have come
before us, all who

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.160
have made it possible
to be here today,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.600
open to a conversation
across many generations

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.430
and with many new
ideas coming together.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.790
This is a privilege
we share, and I really

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.920
appreciate your thoughts
about that as you go

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.850
through the rest of your day.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.020
So on behalf of
our partners, I am

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.950
thrilled by your interest in
the significance of archives

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.840
and the role of the
national government.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.500
It is an honor for IU to host
this discussion as we kick off

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.710
American Archives Month
as well as a month

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.150
celebrating archives of
the state of Indiana.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.770
Thanks to a formal
proclamation by our governor.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.979
Our partners for this gathering
are listed on the screen above.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.840
Though, I am specifically
calling attention

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.490
to our friends at
the Luddy School

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.310
of Informatics Department
of Information and Library

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.220
Science, the Hamilton
Lugar School of Global

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.250
and International Studies,
and the Paul O'Neill

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.040
School of Public and
Environmental Affairs.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.345
If you are here as part of
the fall 2023 Themester, Lux

00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:33.390
et Veritas, you deserve
a special welcome.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.790
Thank you to the College
of Arts and Sciences

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.920
for more than a
decade of engaged

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.460
learning through the exceptional
issues based Themester

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.620
teaching and programming.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.790
It turns out that this
year's Themester theme, light

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.400
and truth, was quite
inspirational to my colleague

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.830
Dina Kellams, Director
of University Archives,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.190
and the incredible team
of archivists she leads.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.530
When they first began
discussing and planning

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:06.350
this year's activities,
they knew right away

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.470
that the person they
wanted to have come,

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.630
who could best
illustrate and illuminate

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.190
how important archives are,
is our former Archivist

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.710
of the United States,
David Ferriero.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.810
In a moment I will
hand over the stage

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.970
to Sara Stefani one
of the IU Library's

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.640
many outstanding archivists,
who will be moderating

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.320
this discussion today.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.880
Sara is the modical--

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.860
political-- modern--
I'm so sorry.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.560
Modern Political Papers
Archivist and she

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.050
joined the IU Libraries
in 2018 to work

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.460
on the papers of the longtime
Indiana Senator, Richard Lugar.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.670
Sara received her doctorate
from Yale University

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.790
in Slavic languages
and literature.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.450
She oversees our collections
of papers from Congresswoman,

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.290
Jill Long Thompson, Senator
Birch Bayh, and Congressman Lee

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.390
Hamilton, among many others.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.360
She is a member of the steering
committee of the Congressional

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.480

American Society of Archivist,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.600
and the president of the
Association of Centers

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.460
for the Study of Congress.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.400
Sarah will be leading the
question and answer session

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.670
with our distinguished
guest, David Ferriero, who

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.160
served as the 10th archivist
of the United States

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.880
from 2009 through April 2022.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.330
President Barack Obama
nominated Mr Ferriero,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.370
who was confirmed
by the US Senate

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.130
and sworn in November of 2020--

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.870
sorry, 2009.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.230
As archivist, Mr Ferriero
oversaw the addition

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.170
of three new
presidential libraries

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.940
to the National Archives
and Records Administration

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.090
Presidential Library systems.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.010
Before leading the
National Archives,

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.580
Mr Ferriero served as
Andrew W. Mellon, director

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.200
of New York Public Library.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.970
He was part of the
leadership team

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.050
responsible for integrating the
four research libraries and 87

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.390
branches to create the
largest public library

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.540
system in the United States
and one of the largest research

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.100
libraries in the world.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.330
Mr Ferriero served in
top leadership positions

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.390
in two of the nation's
highly ranked universities,

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.190

of Technology in Cambridge,

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.200
Massachusetts, and Duke
University in Durham, North

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.070
Carolina.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.570
Mr Ferriero earned bachelor's
degrees and master's degrees

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.420

Northeastern University

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.080

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.050
Mr Ferriero also served as
a Navy hospital corpsman

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.580
during the Vietnam War.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.660
Before we jump into
the Q&A our moderator,

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.840
Sara Stefani has a
few details regarding

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.470
audience participation.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.290
And I'm going to
hand things over

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.360
to Sarah's very capable hands.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.250
And I sincerely
appreciate all of you

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.450
being in attendance today.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.670
Thank you.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.670


00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.590
SARA STEFANI: Hello, everyone.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.680
I want to thank everyone
for coming today.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.730
As Diane mentioned,
this is a celebration

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.280
of National Archives Month.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.710
And also, this particular month
of October 2023, Governor Eric

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.680
Holcomb has decreed as
Indiana Archives Month.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.230
So of course, there's
no better person

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.390
to have come to
talk about archives

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.650
than David Ferriero, the 10th
archivist of the United States.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.130
And as far as audience
participation goes,

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.430
we will have a sing
along a little bit later.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.930
No I'm just kidding.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:46.180
So essentially, what we
plan to do today is David

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.510
and I will have a Q&A
session of our own

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.370
but possibly even
just a conversation.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.903
I mean, we kind of hope
that this will be a--

00:06:56.903 --> 00:06:57.820
DAVID FERRIERO: Loose.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.237
SARA STEFANI: A
loose conversation

00:06:59.237 --> 00:07:01.960
that's of benefit to everybody.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.560
But also there are
pre-selected or-- sorry,

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.540
pre-submitted questions.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.610
I think most of you who RSVP'd--

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.800
or all of you who are RSVP'd--

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.060
received a link to potentially
submit questions ahead of time.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:21.260
If you didn't submit any
questions, that's fine.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.600
You may not have had any.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.110
But during the course
of our conversation

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.160
questions may arise.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.190
And this is why I
think all of you

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.640
have a note card and
a writing utensil.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.750
And so please feel free to
write down any questions

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.010
that you may have.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.310
And at approximately 4:45--

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.470
so maybe in about
a half an hour--

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.570
my colleagues at the
University Archives,

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.480
Dina Kellams and Carrie
Schweer, will come by

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.340
and collect your note cards.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:56.210
And then I will hand the
floor over to your questions,

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.090
meaning that I'll take the
cards and read them all out.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.420
So we will have your
input and the things

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.720
that interest you all.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.670
So with that, I
guess we will start.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.690
Actually, my first
question is unplanned

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.250
because it's
something that I just

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:19.400
learned right at the beginning
of this event, which is--

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.790
David, would you
like to tell us.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.780
So as soon as you
came into the room,

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.910
you recognized these murals.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:30.050
And you asked, are these
Thomas Hart Benton?

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.250
And why did you ask that?

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.870
What prompted you?

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.770
DAVID FERRIERO: Because
I recognized his style.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.929
And a wonderful story about
Harry S. Truman Presidential

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:47.120
Library, where we have
a Thomas Hart Benton.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.740
And Benton painted it while
Harry was still alive.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.750
And we have
wonderful photographs

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:59.840
in the Library of Benton
on a ladder painting

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.920
next to Harry Truman on the
ladder painting a cloud.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.470
And we also have wonderful
photographs of Benton,

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:13.130
after Harry left, painting
over what Harry did.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.817
SARA STEFANI: So
essentially erasing history.

00:09:19.817 --> 00:09:21.150
DAVID FERRIERO: It's underneath.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.170
It's underneath.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.810
It's still there.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.450
SARA STEFANI: So my first
question, essentially,

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.640
was to ask you about being
the archivist of the United

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.600
States, which later
I'm going to follow up

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.200
to ask you to explain to the
audience what a Presidential

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.070
Library is.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:43.320
But first let me ask you--
just for our general crowd--

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.540
can you explain a
little bit of what

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.507
does it mean to be the
archivist of the United States?

00:09:49.507 --> 00:09:51.840
DAVID FERRIERO: A lot of
things that they didn't tell me

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.137
during the interview process.

00:09:53.137 --> 00:09:53.970
SARA STEFANI: Right.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.443
Or in library
school, I'm assuming.

00:09:55.443 --> 00:09:56.610
DAVID FERRIERO: Forget that.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:56.970
SARA STEFANI: Yeah, forget that.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:57.360
[LAUGHS]

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.235
DAVID FERRIERO: Yeah.

00:09:58.235 --> 00:09:58.740
Right.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.440
The Archivist of
the United States

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:07.110
is responsible for overseeing
the creation, management,

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:12.180
and access to the
records created

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.380
by the federal government.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.490
SARA STEFANI: OK.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.460
DAVID FERRIERO: To follow a
prescribed set of laws, Federal

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.050
Records Act,
Presidential Records

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.390
Act, that kind of lay
down the law about how

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.280
things should work.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:36.220
And provide access to the papers
of the government in order

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.560
for the American people
to hold their government

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.130
accountable for its actions
and to learn from our past.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.210
SARA STEFANI: OK.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.978
So how does one become the
Archivist of the United States.

00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:48.520
DAVID FERRIERO: Well there was
this ad in the New York Times.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:48.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.100
SARA STEFANI: I was going
to say, I'm an archivist

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.860
and I want to be the Archivist
of the United States someday.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.240
So.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.310
Yeah, do I check Indeed or?

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:58.810
DAVID FERRIERO: It
was very strange.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.710
I was at the New
York Public Library

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:08.470
and what looks like a very
cushy job from this perspective.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.050
I had a wonderful
office on Fifth Avenue

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.900
with a lion outside my window.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.200
SARA STEFANI: Ooh.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.140
DAVID FERRIERO: And a Friday
afternoon in April of whatever,

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.240
2009.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.070
My assistant came in
and said the White

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.420
House is on the phone.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.672
So I got on the phone.

00:11:25.672 --> 00:11:26.880
SARA STEFANI: Was it April 1?

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.570
DAVID FERRIERO: No, it wasn't.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.620
[SUBDUED LAUGHTER]

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.590
It was around Patriots Day.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.720
So it was like the
middle of the month.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.170
So I got on the phone, Hello.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.530
And this 12-year-old, who
was working on appointments

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.080
for the president, said--

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.847
I guess I wasn't enthusiastic
enough because he said--

00:11:45.847 --> 00:11:48.180
aren't you surprised to be
getting a call from the White

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:48.750
House?

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.493
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:50.493 --> 00:11:51.240
Ah.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.470
So we moved beyond
that, and he said

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.990
that, I'm calling
because we're looking

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.830
at for the position of
archivist of the United States.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.930
So this is a
presidential appointment.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.860
And my sense of things
at that point-- and even

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.610
now-- is that presidential
appointments are usually

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:15.060
someone who gave a lot of
money to the campaign that

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.640
elected the president, or is
a friend of the president,

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.580
but doesn't know anything
about the business

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.170
of that particular position.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.110
So why on Earth are
you calling me--

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.530
--who knows the
business and doesn't

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:30.830
meet those other criteria?

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.287
So he couldn't answer that.

00:12:33.287 --> 00:12:35.120
SARA STEFANI: Did you
actually ask him that?

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:35.912
DAVID FERRIERO: No.

00:12:35.912 --> 00:12:36.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.290
I said, I'm very
flattered, but you're

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.230
looking at the wrong
person and made it clear

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.090
that this was the end
of the conversation.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.980
And he said, well,
would you think about it

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.680
over the weekend, and
we'll talk again on Monday.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.010
And I said, sure.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.045
So he called Monday morning.

00:12:51.045 --> 00:12:52.420
And we had the
same conversation.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.060
And 10 minutes later
an adult called.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:59.530
The poor kid, Kyle Watkins, was
an undergraduate at Georgetown

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.480
working on appointments.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.770
SARA STEFANI: Oh.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.270
DAVID FERRIERO: He
wasn't in charge,

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.780
but he was the one who did
the research that found me.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:08.680
SARA STEFANI: Oh-ho.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.180
DAVID FERRIERO: So
he got the honor

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.510
of calling me to tell me all
this, and I treated him poorly.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.980
So 10 minutes later
an adult called

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.630
and asked if he could
come to New York

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.890
and talk to me about the job.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.880
And that week Tom
Wheeler, who turned out

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.780
to be the director
of the FCC later,

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.720
came and talked about what
the president was looking

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.500
for in the new archivist, and
how important the archives was

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.870
going to be in the
administration's

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.740
open government initiative.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.900
And the more he talked,
the more excited

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.090
I got about the potential.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.860
And knowing that I
know the business,

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.730
I was responsible for archives
at MIT, and Duke, and the New

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:52.960
York Public Library.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.032
So it's not as if I
didn't know the business.

00:13:56.032 --> 00:13:57.490
SARA STEFANI: Right,
because people

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.662
have pointed out that
you're the first librarian.

00:13:59.662 --> 00:14:01.120
DAVID FERRIERO:
Very controversial.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.830
Let me tell you,
very controversial.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:04.460
SARA STEFANI: For those of you
who aren't in the business--

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.543
DAVID FERRIERO: Oh my god.

00:14:05.543 --> 00:14:07.840
SARA STEFANI: It actually
is kind of controversial.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.007
DAVID FERRIERO: Yeah there's
a woman named Harriet--

00:14:10.007 --> 00:14:12.700
who I'm still looking for-- when
my nomination was announced,

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.230
who said on some listserv--

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.092
I can't remember which one it
was-- he's only a librarian.

00:14:17.092 --> 00:14:17.842
SARA STEFANI: Ooh.

00:14:17.842 --> 00:14:19.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.360
Welcome to the IU
libraries, everyone.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.110
DAVID FERRIERO: But there
has been, historically,

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.110
a lot of, I wouldn't
say tension,

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:34.470
but difference among the
librarians and archivists.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.000
It's the same business, please.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.110
It's the same business.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.843
Collect, protect, encourage
the use of, fill in the blank.

00:14:39.843 --> 00:14:40.635
SARA STEFANI: Yeah.

00:14:40.635 --> 00:14:43.680


00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.570
So you were nominated
for the position

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:46.950
by President Barack Obama.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:47.950
DAVID FERRIERO: Exactly.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.110
SARA STEFANI: But you served
under President Obama,

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.500
President Trump, and
then President Biden.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.490
So you've kind of--

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.323
DAVID FERRIERO: It's a
lifetime appointment.

00:14:55.323 --> 00:14:57.640
There is no term for the
archivists in the United

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.130
States.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.310
So at the end of
an administration

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.400
there are 4,000
presidential appointments.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.870
And at the end of
an administration

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.400
4,000 people leave.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.900
And so if you have a
presidential appointment,

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.210
you get a notice from
the incoming president

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:18.160
asking you to submit
your resignation,

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.460
except the archivist
doesn't get that notice.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.210
SARA STEFANI: Oh, well,
that's a job perk.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.127
DAVID FERRIERO: Right.

00:15:23.127 --> 00:15:24.280
SARA STEFANI: Yeah.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.530
DAVID FERRIERO: So one
of the huge challenges

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.270
for the National
Archives is to ensure

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.760
that those 4,000
people who are leaving

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.100
are leaving their
records behind.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.030
SARA STEFANI: Right.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.740
DAVID FERRIERO: And
more challenging

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.680
is to ensure that those
4,000 people coming in

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.947
know what the rules are.

00:15:39.947 --> 00:15:40.780
SARA STEFANI: Right.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.470
Yeah.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.740
So you kind of touched
on this a little bit,

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.385
but you were nominated in--

00:15:48.385 --> 00:15:53.110
I think it was July
of 2009, correct?

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:57.460
And you were confirmed-- so
all presidential appointments

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.850
have to be vetted by the
United States Senate.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.220
There are confirmation hearings.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.730
Some of you might have
watched them on CNN or c-span.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:11.353
So everyone has to go
through the whole grilling

00:16:11.353 --> 00:16:12.520
process of having a hearing.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.770
DAVID FERRIERO: Very Invasive.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.630
SARA STEFANI: Right, and
so you were actually--

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:21.040
I think that you were
nominated in July of 2009

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.570
and then confirmed in November.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:23.020
DAVID FERRIERO: November

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.940
SARA STEFANI: So essentially
three months later.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.720
DAVID FERRIERO: Right

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.053
SARA STEFANI: The current
Archivist of the United States

00:16:28.053 --> 00:16:31.450
was nominated in, I
think, August of 2022

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.960
and wasn't confirmed
until May of 2023.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.280
So it took nine months
to get her confirmed.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.950
So what is that process like?

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.910
What is it like to be nominated
and go through that kind of--

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.950
DAVID FERRIERO: As I
said, it's very invasive.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:52.180


00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.800
So when Tom left
my office, he said,

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.860
would you come to Washington
and talk some more?

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.830
And that's when I met
with the full committee

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.360
at the White House and
talked about the job.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.368
And as I was leaving
the room, David Jacobson

00:17:06.368 --> 00:17:08.780
who was the head of that--

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.579
Who was Kyle's boss said, so can
we consider you our candidate.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:13.540
And I said, yes.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.670
And at that point
it was locked down.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.740
I couldn't talk to
anyone except my wife

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.390
about what was going on.

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:23.230
And that launched an
investigative process.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.470
FBI agents spread out
across the country talking

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.470
to anyone I ever had known.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:35.540
And I kept getting these emails
from folks, friends saying,

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.780
what the hell is going on?

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.640
The FBI is at my door.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.810
SARA STEFANI: Oh no.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.370
That is not what
you want to hear.

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.745
DAVID FERRIERO:
All they can tell

00:17:43.745 --> 00:17:45.742
me is that it's not a
criminal investigation.

00:17:45.742 --> 00:17:46.450
SARA STEFANI: Oh.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.360
Thanks, yeah.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.600
DAVID FERRIERO: So I
passed those tests.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.310
And then the next
phase is you have

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.550
to meet with every member
of the Senate Committee

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.690
that's voting on you.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:07.430
So a White House
shepherd and I visited

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.050
each member of the committee.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:13.940
And my favorite visit was
with an unnamed Senator who

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.257
asked me the killer question.

00:18:15.257 --> 00:18:16.340
SARA STEFANI: Which state?

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.990
DAVID FERRIERO: I'm not even
going to mention the state.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.375
SARA STEFANI: I'm just kidding.

00:18:18.375 --> 00:18:18.760
[LAUGHS]

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.843
DAVID FERRIERO: They asked
me the killer question,

00:18:20.843 --> 00:18:23.790
so why is it that you want to
be the architect of the United

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.290
States?

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:24.998
SARA STEFANI: Oh.

00:18:24.998 --> 00:18:27.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.280
Yeah.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.508
And you said, because I
like domes and columns.

00:18:32.508 --> 00:18:34.550
DAVID FERRIERO: No, I
pretended he said archivist

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:38.650
and I talked about his
records, his papers.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.910
And as we were leaving, the
shepherd turned to me and said,

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.250
did he say architect?

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.088
SARA STEFANI: Because there is
an archivist-- or architect.

00:18:47.088 --> 00:18:48.380
DAVID FERRIERO: Of the Capitol.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.588
SARA STEFANI: Of the Capitol.

00:18:49.588 --> 00:18:50.210
Right, so.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.770
DAVID FERRIERO: Not architect
of the United States.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:52.070
SARA STEFANI: No,no,no.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:53.760
No architect of
the United States.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.180
So.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.670
DAVID FERRIERO: So
then as a hearing.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:03.830
And I think I'm
the last person who

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.708
had a swift appointment and
then a vote by the full Senate.

00:19:06.708 --> 00:19:07.500
SARA STEFANI: Yeah.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.292
You know, because--

00:19:08.292 --> 00:19:12.360
DAVID FERRIERO: But as
you've seen recently,

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.750
any member of the Senate could
put a hold on a nomination.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:16.500
SARA STEFANI: Yeah

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.840
DAVID FERRIERO: And Lamar
Alexander of Tennessee

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.245
put a hold on my nomination.

00:19:20.245 --> 00:19:21.120
SARA STEFANI: Really?

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.020
DAVID FERRIERO: Yeah.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.015
The White House
couldn't figure out--

00:19:24.015 --> 00:19:25.890
nobody could figure out
what the problem was.

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:30.270
So they sent me to meet with
Lamar, who was very embarrassed

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.100
that he had put a hold on it.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.610
But it turns out that
one of his constituents

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:39.180
reported that the director
of the Nixon Library

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.970
was saying some pretty
anti-Nixon things,

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.490
and he thought I
should know about that.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.010
And once he got
that off the table,

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.680
then we had a wonderful
conversation about his--

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.940
he used to be a president of
the University of Tennessee.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.180
So we talked about
higher education.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.640
He really embarrassed
because his wife, Honey,

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.850
was on the National
Archives Foundation board.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:02.850
SARA STEFANI: Ooh-ho-ho.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.050
DAVID FERRIERO: So she
wasn't happy about him

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:08.020
putting a hold on it.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.860
So as soon as I left the
office, they lifted the hold.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:18.748
And I think it was the last
unanimous vote on a nomination.

00:20:18.748 --> 00:20:19.540
SARA STEFANI: Yeah.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.410
Well, yeah.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.470
Because, like I said, the
current Archivist of the United

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.000
States, it was very con--

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.190
Not, I think, because of her.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.690
But--

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.880
DAVID FERRIERO: No,
it's the dysfunction

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:36.130
of the Hill in terms of
the non-partisan approach

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:36.970
to everything.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:38.380
SARA STEFANI: Right.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.220
So just to clarify for everyone.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.460
So you essentially
are the director

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.440
and the head of the
National Archives, right.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.480
Technically the National
Archives and Records

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.890
Administration.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.960
And I kind of, and
correct me if I'm wrong,

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.560
but I think part
of the reason why

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:01.060
there is such an invasive
process for vetting

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.030
the potential Archivist
of the United States,

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:09.400
and sending the FBI, and finding
out everything from everyone

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:14.440
who ever knew you is because
you have access to some really

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.200
important documents.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:17.867
No is this not--

00:21:17.867 --> 00:21:19.492
DAVID FERRIERO: The
process is the same

00:21:19.492 --> 00:21:20.867
for any presidential
appointment.

00:21:20.867 --> 00:21:21.825
SARA STEFANI: Oh, Yeah.

00:21:21.825 --> 00:21:22.720
Well no, I know that.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.420
But I guess it's
this idea that they

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.090
don't want anyone, any
presidential appointment,

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.810
to be in a position
to be blackmailed--

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.060
DAVID FERRIERO: Oh yeah, sure.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.977
SARA STEFANI: --or to
have something over you,

00:21:32.977 --> 00:21:37.840
or be able to leak documents,
or do anything like this.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.580
And in your case, with
the National Archives,

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.940
this is the home of
all of the founding

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.220
documents of this country.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.350
The Declaration of
Independence is there.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.910
The US Constitution.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.220
The Bill of Rights.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.320
And they're on display.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.650
They're just in this
wonderful display area.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.430
When I visited
several years ago,

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.240
there were a lot of school kids.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:05.350
It was a very popular
school kid destination.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:09.513
I actually read that you
wanted to do sleepovers.

00:22:09.513 --> 00:22:10.930
DAVID FERRIERO:
We did sleepovers.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.030
SARA STEFANI: Did you do
sleepovers in the rotunda?

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.572
Was it just for school kids, or
were adults part of this too?

00:22:15.572 --> 00:22:17.410
DAVID FERRIERO:
Twice a year we did,

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:18.712
for kids 8 to 12 years old.

00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:19.420
SARA STEFANI: OK.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.000
DAVID FERRIERO: They had
to come with an adult.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.490
And we were limited
to, I think, 80 people.

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:31.420
We started on a
Saturday night evening.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.600
We had a whole evening full
of activities for them,

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:39.378
scavenger hunts, and
movies, and snacks, and--

00:22:39.378 --> 00:22:41.920
SARA STEFANI: Not peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches, though.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.150
Near the--

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:46.270
DAVID FERRIERO: Yeah, we
had a special area for food.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.680
Not in the rotunda--

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.850
SARA STEFANI: Not with
the Declaration of--

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:49.350
OK.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.200
DAVID FERRIERO: No.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.800
And they brought sleeping
bags and stuff to sleep.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:59.240
And lights out at 11 o'clock.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.000
And they slept on the
floor of the rotunda

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.010
in the presence of the charters.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.504
SARA STEFANI: Wow.

00:23:05.504 --> 00:23:08.010
DAVID FERRIERO: And
on Sunday morning,

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:09.710
we did a pancake breakfast.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:10.832
I flipped pancakes.

00:23:10.832 --> 00:23:11.540
SARA STEFANI: Oh.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.230
[LAUGHS]

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:13.730
DAVID FERRIERO: Yeah,
it was a lot of fun.

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:14.938
SARA STEFANI: Oh, that's so--

00:23:14.938 --> 00:23:17.450
And the way I
understand it is, that

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:22.070
was part of a very important
initiative to you, which

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:26.810
was to make the collections
of the National Archives

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:28.010
accessible to people.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:32.120
And invite the public in
and kind of break down

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.905
that barrier.

00:23:33.905 --> 00:23:35.030
So was that a part of that?

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.460
DAVID FERRIERO: It was a
piece of the open government

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:41.770
initiative where we
were trying to make

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.730
each agency more
user responsive,

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.366
more reflective of the--

00:23:47.366 --> 00:23:50.108
to break down those walls.

00:23:50.108 --> 00:23:50.900
SARA STEFANI: Yeah.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:55.770
And so the National
Archives, like I said,

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:58.200
has these founding documents
of the country in it.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.110
And it has things like the
Emancipation Proclamation

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:04.083
and the Treaty of the
Louisiana Purchase.

00:24:04.083 --> 00:24:05.250
DAVID FERRIERO: My favorite.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:09.600
SARA STEFANI: Yeah,
but there's also over--

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.550
approximately-- 13 billion other
analog materials, photographs,

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:15.840
documents, maps.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.170
DAVID FERRIERO: No that
doesn't include photographs.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:18.545
There are 43
million photographs.

00:24:18.545 --> 00:24:20.470
SARA STEFANI: 43,
well, 43 million.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:21.450
I did the math.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:22.470
That's 13.8 billion.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:23.800
Oh, 43 million photographs?

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.050
DAVID FERRIERO: I used to
scare the staff when I said,

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:27.450
we should be doing an inventory.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:28.242
SARA STEFANI: Yeah.

00:24:28.242 --> 00:24:32.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:33.990
I will try to ignore that.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:35.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:40.440
And then over 33 billion
electronic records

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.340
and counting.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.423
I assume, right?

00:24:42.423 --> 00:24:44.340
DAVID FERRIERO: Where
did you get that figure?

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.810
SARA STEFANI: Off
of your website.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.102
DAVID FERRIERO: Not 33 billion.

00:24:47.102 --> 00:24:48.668
SARA STEFANI: 33
billion with a b.

00:24:48.668 --> 00:24:49.460
DAVID FERRIERO: No.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:49.890
SARA STEFANI: Billion.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:50.610
DAVID FERRIERO: No.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:51.270
SARA STEFANI: Oh.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.040
Well then the website
needs to be updated.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:53.910
DAVID FERRIERO: I
guess it's wrong.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:54.702
SARA STEFANI: Yeah.

00:24:54.702 --> 00:24:57.522
DAVID FERRIERO: It's like six
billion electronic records.

00:24:57.522 --> 00:24:58.230
SARA STEFANI: Oh.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.018
Well, the website is wrong.

00:25:00.018 --> 00:25:00.810
DAVID FERRIERO: OK.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:01.602
SARA STEFANI: Yeah.

00:25:01.602 --> 00:25:02.185
So.

00:25:02.185 --> 00:25:03.810
DAVID FERRIERO: Not
my problem anymore.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:05.018
SARA STEFANI: Right, exactly.

00:25:05.018 --> 00:25:07.380
Not your problem anymore.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.493
So what else?

00:25:08.493 --> 00:25:10.410
I mean, what are some
of your favorite things.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.600
Like, what other
collections are there

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:17.100
besides federal records,
and Presidential Records,

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.102
and official records,
but what else is there?

00:25:19.102 --> 00:25:20.560
DAVID FERRIERO: A
couple of things.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.560
One of one of my favorite
parts of the collection

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:30.510
are the treaties that we
signed with Native nations.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:35.550
So there are 375 of them which
have been digitized and are now

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:39.030
up and available on our website.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:44.310
They're the saddest documents,
I think, in our collection.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.140
Because they spell
out everything

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.540
that we promised to the
Indians while we grabbed

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:49.830
their land and their water.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:56.850
And visited frequently by
tribal elders and tribal lawyers

00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:02.400
who are working on federal cases
on land reuse and water rights.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.430
So that's one piece
of the collection.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:09.740
But there's another
piece too that I would

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.510
put in the favorite category.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.670
When I became the
archivist and met

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.475
with the directors of the
Presidential Libraries

00:26:16.475 --> 00:26:18.350
for the first time, they
went around the room

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.700
and introduced themselves.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.920
And the director of
the Kennedy handed me

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.500
a copy of a letter that a
kid wrote to the president,

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:29.090
asking for information about
the proposed Peace Corps.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:30.410
It's a letter from me.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:31.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.022
SARA STEFANI: Yeah.

00:26:32.022 --> 00:26:33.980
DAVID FERRIERO: Two weeks
later, the Eisenhower

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.980
called to say they had
found two letters from me

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.250
to President Eisenhower.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.650
And when I was at the
LBJ, they handed me

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:43.280
a copy of the letter that I
sent to LBJ, congratulating him

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.960
for signing the
Civil Rights Act.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.830
SARA STEFANI: Yeah.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.090
This actually--

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:48.620
DAVID FERRIERO:
Those are records,

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.480
presidential correspondence.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.630
SARA STEFANI: Actually,
so recently, I

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:57.230
received an email from
somebody you have met before.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:59.480
He's an educator who
lives in North Carolina.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:04.600
And his advice to me was,
when you talk to David,

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.930
you might ask him about
some of the artifacts he

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:09.480
had in his office,
including a letter

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.115
he wrote to LBJ and perhaps--

00:27:11.115 --> 00:27:12.240
DAVID FERRIERO: Facsimiles.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.698
SARA STEFANI:
Facsimiles, for sure.

00:27:13.698 --> 00:27:15.480
For sure.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.130
But I thought this was a great--

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.080
that these letters
were from you.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.180
And you found them
in the archives,

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.660
which struck me
because, essentially,

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:28.740
we, as citizens,
are in the archives.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.620
It is not just for
Presidential Records

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.290
and of course, it is for that.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.780
But we're all in
it, essentially.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.492
DAVID FERRIERO: One of the
activities for the sleepover

00:27:39.492 --> 00:27:40.950
is kids get an
opportunity to write

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.360
a letter to the president.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.380
And we deliver them.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.588
On Monday morning we deliver
them to the White House,

00:27:45.588 --> 00:27:48.390
and President Obama responded.

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.110
SARA STEFANI: Awe.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:53.520
That reminds me
actually of, in 2018,

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.710
when I had an
opportunity to visit

00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:00.860
Richard Lugar at
his office, and I

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.240
had my picture taken with him.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.450
And in the mail I
got a signed copy.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.150
And I said, do I
have to archive this?

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:09.305
Like, I have this picture.

00:28:09.305 --> 00:28:10.400
DAVID FERRIERO: [LAUGHS]

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.790
SARA STEFANI: But
I've also read things,

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:17.000
where for instance, the
National Archives has veterans

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.430
records and military records.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:23.090
And you, yourself,
are a veteran, right.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:27.110
And there were several blog
posts about the 1950 census

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:30.350
which was recently
released, and people

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.320
who found their relatives
online, or found

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.260
their parents in the census.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.430
So essentially, again, we're
all in the National Archives.

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:41.900
DAVID FERRIERO: Exactly.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.200
So when I visited Saint Louis,
where our military records are,

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.820
there's a special vault
for high-end veterans.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.930
Records that we want make
sure we want to make sure

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:59.520
aren't tampered or messed up.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.360
Not that there's a
lot of that goes on.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.940
But the VIP vaults.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.360
So they took me on a
tour of the VIP vault

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.222
and handed me Elvis's
service record.

00:29:09.222 --> 00:29:09.930
SARA STEFANI: Oh.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:13.770
And was it?

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:17.502
Oh Yeah, so I think
that recently--

00:29:17.502 --> 00:29:19.210
and I want to see if
this is still true--

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:22.980
but recently we watched a
program from the New York

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.690
Historical Society
that was an interview

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.030
with the current Archivist
of the United States, Colleen

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:27.570
Shogan.

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.280
And she was asked
the question of what

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.000
is the most requested
and popular item.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.340
And she said it was
the photograph of Elvis

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.667
with President Richard Nixon.

00:29:36.667 --> 00:29:37.500
DAVID FERRIERO: Yes.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.040
SARA STEFANI: Is that?

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.060
DAVID FERRIERO:
It's a great story.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.480
SARA STEFANI: Yeah?

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.210
DAVID FERRIERO: You
want to hear it?

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:40.830
SARA STEFANI: Absolutely.

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:41.380
DAVID FERRIERO: OK.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.922
SARA STEFANI: Do
you want to hear it?

00:29:42.922 --> 00:29:44.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:49.380
DAVID FERRIERO: So
Elvis collected badges.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:53.400
And he had badges from
all over the country.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.570
And the one that he really
wanted was an FBI badge,

00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:00.300
and the FBI refused
to give him a badge.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:08.370
So he took it upon himself
to fly from Los Angeles--

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:09.480
he was on the West Coast.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.710
He flew to Washington
on American Airlines

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:17.700
because he asked the flight
attendant for stationery

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:22.980
to write a letter
to President Nixon,

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.580
asking to meet with him
because he wanted to volunteer

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.440
for his war on drugs.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.030
Nothing about badges.

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:31.350
Nothing about badges.

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:32.250
SARA STEFANI: Oh.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.850
DAVID FERRIERO: And he and he
got into a cab at the airport

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:39.480
and got delivered
to the West Wing

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.005
gate, where he handed the
letter in, which you can't do.

00:30:43.005 --> 00:30:44.130
They won't accept anything.

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:48.180
So don't try and leave a letter
at the gate at the White House.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.910
And it ended up in Bud Krogh--

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:53.220
Bud Krogh, who
was chief of Staff

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.940
to President Nixon
and a huge Elvis fan.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.070
It ended up in his hands.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:04.760
And sure enough, Elvis was
invited, that afternoon,

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.570
to come and to visit
with the president.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:12.150


00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:13.470
Bud did a program with us.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:17.280
And if you google Bud Krogh
Elvis National Archives,

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.650
you can watch this
wonderful conversation

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.840
with Bud telling
the story of Nixon

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.550
not really knowing
who Elvis was.

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:26.670
And do I really have
to meet with him?

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.500
And all of this.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.590


00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.410
There wasn't any conversation
about drugs or anything

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:38.070
in this one on one
with the president,

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.920
but he got to the point
where he wanted a badge.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.830
He really wanted an FBI badge,
so he asked Nixon for it.

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:46.620
And Nixon turned to Bud
and said, can I do that?

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.810
And Bud Krogh says,
of course you can.

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:49.710
You're the president.

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:50.725
So guess what?

00:31:50.725 --> 00:31:52.350
SARA STEFANI: Did he
get the FBI badge?

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.910
DAVID FERRIERO: He
got the FBI badge.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:56.340
And then Bud tells
the story of--

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.380
this is true of every president.

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.920
The resolute desk
has a bottom drawer

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.730
full of gifts that the
president gives to visitors

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.160
and they're arranged
in priority order,

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.320
for the cheap stuff at the front
and the really expensive stuff

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.280
at the back.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.450
So Nixon said to Elvis, I
want to give you a gift.

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.850
So Elvis got up out of
his chair and went around

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:22.930
the back of the desk instead
of waiting for the president.

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:24.700
And he goes and pulls up--

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.070
I forget what he pulled
out-- but went right

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.170
to the back of the
drawer and pulled out

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:30.362
the most expensive stuff.

00:32:30.362 --> 00:32:31.570
SARA STEFANI: The good stuff.

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:32.230
Yeah.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:34.270
[LAUGHS]

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:38.140
DAVID FERRIERO: So we have the
letter in the Nixon Library.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:42.040
We have the letter that Elvis
wrote and wonderful pictures.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.850
And the picture is on shower
curtains, coffee mugs.

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:48.340
It's on T-shirts, sweatshirts.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.770
It's on everything.

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:55.600
SARA STEFANI: And so
along those lines,

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.710
where do Presidential records
and Presidential papers

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:03.430
fit in to all of this?

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:08.260
DAVID FERRIERO: As of 1978,
because President Nixon

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:12.670
considered his papers
private, not public--

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:14.710
and the whole Watergate thing--

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:18.610
Congress decided we need
to codify this and make

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.110
it clear that Presidential
records are public records.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.430
So they belong to the
federal government.

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:28.150
And the way it
works is the records

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:32.320
are maintained in
the White House

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.170
during the administration.

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:38.650
And it isn't until
the inauguration

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.950
of the new president,
during that ceremony,

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:45.280
that the records are transferred
to the National Archives.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.718
They stay in the White
House until then.

00:33:48.718 --> 00:33:51.010
SARA STEFANI: So you kind of
touched on it a little bit

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:54.640
about the personal ownership
versus the public ownership,

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.130
because for centuries--

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:01.150
I mean 1 and 1/2
centuries, 150 years--

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:03.822
Presidential papers were
considered personal property.

00:34:03.822 --> 00:34:06.280
DAVID FERRIERO: And they're
scattered all over the country.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:06.760
SARA STEFANI: Yeah.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.010
DAVID FERRIERO: Library of
Congress has a lot of them.

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.790
But it wasn't until
FDR, actually,

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:15.429
who had the first
Presidential Library.

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.820
I'm convinced that FDR
was a closet archivist,

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.469
because he really paid--

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:22.060
SARA STEFANI: There are a lot
of them out there, actually.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.143
DAVID FERRIERO: I know it.

00:34:23.143 --> 00:34:25.330
He really paid attention
to organization.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:29.139
And he actually-- you probably
don't know this-- but,

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:33.909
you archivists, he created
the prototype phase box

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:35.675
that you now store
your records in.

00:34:35.675 --> 00:34:36.550
SARA STEFANI: Really?

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.560
DAVID FERRIERO: It
wasn't with acid free--

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.580
SARA STEFANI: The archivists
are really excited about this.

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:40.639
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:43.097
DAVID FERRIERO: It wasn't with
acid free paper or anything,

00:34:43.097 --> 00:34:44.710
but it's the same box.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.460
SARA STEFANI: I read
an interesting thing.

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.610
So I want to touch on this issue
of the Presidential Libraries,

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.300
because you mentioned
it with Truman.

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.842
And you've talked
about a little bit.

00:34:52.842 --> 00:34:55.130
But a little tidbit that
I found out about FDR,

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:57.800
so Franklin Roosevelt
was the first president

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.240
to start a Presidential
Library, right.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.240
So it's to look at
everything and say, Wow, I've

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.830
got a lot of cool stuff.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.270
I should make it accessible
to the American people.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.630
And so he established
a library and a museum.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:13.430
And he had tons of gifts,
and memorabilia, and chairs,

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:14.390
and I don't know what.

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:17.420
And the archivist who was
working with him said, do you

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.943
really need all of this?

00:35:18.943 --> 00:35:21.110
Do you really want to put
all of this in the museum?

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.630
And he said, if people
are going to pay a quarter

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:27.950
to come to this library,
they need to see some stuff.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:29.630
They're paying a quarter.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.960
But could you talk a little
bit about what a Presidential

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:37.010
Library is versus the
Presidential Records

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:38.527
that go into the
National Archives

00:35:38.527 --> 00:35:39.860
and what that system looks like.

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.330
DAVID FERRIERO:
It's a combination.

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:44.430
It's artifacts and records.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:50.890
So state gifts and lots of
gifts from the American public

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:54.100
all become part of-- those
are considered records--

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:58.210
and become part of the museum
aspect of the Presidential

00:35:58.210 --> 00:35:59.230
Library.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.600
We have a wonderful--

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.320
the largest collection of
macaroni paintings in the world

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.420
are in our
Presidential Libraries.

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.450
We have every shoe that
Hillary Clinton ever wore.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:12.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:17.350
We have a lot of First
Lady [LAUGHS] wardrobes.

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:22.295
And Hillary Clinton is still
delivering shoes to the Clinton

00:36:22.295 --> 00:36:23.170
Presidential Library.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:26.480


00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.240
Very strange collections.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.190
SARA STEFANI: But the
public can visit them.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.610
DAVID FERRIERO: Yes.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:31.930
SARA STEFANI: And
they have exhibitions.

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:32.930
DAVID FERRIERO: Exactly.

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:34.600
SARA STEFANI: And you
can see the shoes.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.940
Can you try them on though?

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.720
DAVID FERRIERO: No.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.638
After I had done my
first tour of all

00:36:39.638 --> 00:36:41.680
the Presidential Libraries
and seen all of these,

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.270
I started putting
things together

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:47.900
and threatened to do a first
lady shoe exhibit from--

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.150
DIANE DALLIS-COMENTALE: I
think the Met did an exhibit

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:51.540
on first lady dresses.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.570
So I don't know why
you wouldn't do shoes.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:54.380
DAVID FERRIERO: We
could do that too.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:54.850
SARA STEFANI: Yeah.

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:55.760
DAVID FERRIERO: Yeah,
we could do that too.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.790
SARA STEFANI: So one of the
things that you also mentioned,

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.220
that is in the
event description,

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:07.160
that I do want to talk about is
the theme for IU's Themester.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.860
This last Themester is
Lux et Veritas, right,

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.880
which translates
into light and truth.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:18.740
It's also actually part of
the motto on the official seal

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.810
of Indiana University.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.660
And I know that when
my colleagues first

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.690
had this idea of celebrating
this last Themester

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:31.610
and inviting you, they had this
really nice idea of shining

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:37.970
the light of truth onto records,
and history, and archives,

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.230
and things along those lines.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.440
And you've talked
about open government

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.820
and the open government system.

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:47.640
Can you talk a little
bit of what that means.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.210
What does open government
mean, and why is it important?

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.460
Why is it an
important principle?

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:58.370
DAVID FERRIERO: So in the Obama
language for open government,

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:01.880
it was transparency,
participation,

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.720
and collaboration.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:07.190
Those are the three linchpins
of what open government means.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:10.190
And for the National
Archives, we

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.440
tried hard to figure
out ways that we

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.580
could fulfill that vision.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.030
So on his first day in
office, the president

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:21.440
met with his senior staff
and made the statement

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.050
that the government doesn't
have all the answers,

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:27.110
and we need to figure out ways
to engage the American public

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:28.830
in doing our work.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:32.150
So we took that very seriously
at the National Archives

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:34.100
and worked on and
thought about ways

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.400
that we could engage
the public in the work

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.030
that we do, which resulted in
the creation of the Citizen

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:45.560
Archivist project, where we have
opportunities for the public

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:50.790
to help us, in a number of ways,
in making access to our records

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:51.610
better.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.390
So, as you probably
know, cursive

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:57.030
isn't taught much
in schools anymore.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:01.470
And about 80% of the Federal
Records are in cursive.

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:04.800
So we have kids now,
and their parents

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.620
in lots of cases, who
can't read these records.

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.510
And in fact, I was
talking to a couple

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:12.270
of adults last night who
couldn't read records,

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:13.287
couldn't read cursive.

00:39:13.287 --> 00:39:15.120
SARA STEFANI: Or even
from the 19th century,

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.030
even if you can read cursive,
it's a different kind

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.830
and it's--

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:20.580
DAVID FERRIERO: Don't
give me any excuses.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:21.747
SARA STEFANI: OK, all right.

00:39:21.747 --> 00:39:22.482
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:22.482 --> 00:39:23.190
I take that back.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:24.990
DAVID FERRIERO: So we
have loaded thousands

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:27.510
of records in the Citizen
Archivist Dashboard

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:29.700
and you can go in and
transcribe for us.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.620
And we've got folks
from, actually,

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.750
around the world who are
participating in this.

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:38.790
And to date, we have I think
the figure is something

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:44.655
like 250 million transcriptions
have been done of our records.

00:39:44.655 --> 00:39:47.280
SARA STEFANI: And this is just,
when you say Citizen Archivist,

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:52.260
this is just people,
just the public.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.350
Well, I mean, these are not
necessarily employees of NARA.

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.142
DAVID FERRIERO: There's
a wonderful nursing

00:39:57.142 --> 00:39:59.980
home in Massachusetts that
has adopted this project.

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.472
And they do they
do transcriptions.

00:40:01.472 --> 00:40:03.180
SARA STEFANI: So this
is for anyone who's

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.130
interested in getting involved.

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:06.270
Is it still going?

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:07.470
Can people still get in--

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.920
DAVID FERRIERO: Oh Yeah

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.390
SARA STEFANI: How they get
involved in the project?

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:10.557
DAVID FERRIERO: Archives.gov

00:40:10.557 --> 00:40:12.610
SARA STEFANI: Archives.gov OK.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:15.300
Do you do crowdsourcing
like, with photographs?

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.800
DAVID FERRIERO: Oh
yeah, we do that.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.300
Yeah.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.587
There are several
different options.

00:40:19.587 --> 00:40:20.670
You can do transcriptions.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.680
You can tag photos.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.020
As I said, we have 43
million photographs

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.430
and not very well described.

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:30.180
So we've loaded
thousands of photographs

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:34.410
where people are tagging people
that they recognize, or places

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:37.470
if they recognize, or whatever
information they might

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:41.040
have about the photograph.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.200
SARA STEFANI: So what
is the result of this.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.830
How many people have been
involved as Citizen Archivists.

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:50.145
And has NARA been
pleased with the results?

00:40:50.145 --> 00:40:51.770
DAVID FERRIERO: The
results have been--

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:53.103
SARA STEFANI: How's the quality?

00:40:53.103 --> 00:40:55.320
DAVID FERRIERO: I can't
give you numbers of people.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.330
But we've been very
pleased with the quality

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:00.800
of the transcriptions
and each one

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.680
is checked to make sure
that it's accurate.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:08.540
Another way that we've focused
on-- this came up in my meeting

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.040
with the students today.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.220


00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:18.740
Every attempt is to make our
content accessible in any way

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.500
we possibly can.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:25.040
So we've devoted a lot of work,
time, and effort on Wikipedia.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:25.790
SARA STEFANI: Yeah

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:28.415
DAVID FERRIERO: Hired the first
federal Wikipedian in residence

00:41:28.415 --> 00:41:31.400
was part of the
National Archives staff,

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:36.020
who had the dual role of
helping us create those links

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:40.200
but also educating the staff
about the power of Wikipedia.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:48.380
So now our processing
folks link record groups

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:52.400
to articles in Wikipedia.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.030
And there are probably
in the neighborhood

00:41:56.030 --> 00:42:01.010
of 4,000 to 5,000
Wikipedia records that

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:05.360
have content that have links
from the National Archives.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:13.160
And we get three billion hits a
year from those Wikipedia hits.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.050
SARA STEFANI: Well,
and also, you also

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:19.970
initiated a huge social
media initiative as well.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.410
DAVID FERRIERO: Yeah.

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:24.980
When I was coming to
Washington for one

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.100
of those meetings on the Hill
with the Senate Committee.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.550
I'm not even the archivist yet,
but I'm reading the New York

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:35.780
Times and there's this article
about the White House letting

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:40.370
an RFP with help on
their social media.

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:41.150
Archiving.

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:42.170
Archiving social media.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:43.310
SARA STEFANI: Oh,
archiving social media.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.440
DAVID FERRIERO: And I'm saying
to myself, oh wait a minute.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.770
Where's the National Archives?

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:48.680
Why aren't they all over this?

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.600
And it turns out that the
National Archives wasn't doing

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.860
anything with social media.

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.240
And this is 2009.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.180
And I discovered that there
was a small group of folks

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:03.690
who were interested
in social media

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:09.690
and were meeting in secret
to talk about their dreams

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:12.750
about how they might
use social media.

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:15.855
And I heard about
this, and I walked

00:43:15.855 --> 00:43:16.980
into one of their meetings.

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.140
And they thought
they were busted.

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.560
And we sat down and had
a great conversation.

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:27.810
And at that meeting I
authorized the purchase

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:38.310
of iPads and iPhones,
25 to fool around.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:40.170
And let's get started here.

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:45.210
And the next morning I got a
call from my CIO, who said,

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:47.310
I understand you want
iPads and iPhones.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:49.030
And I said, Yeah,
isn't it exciting.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.040
We're going to experiment
and blah, blah, blah.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.790
And she said, well, you know, we
don't support that technology.

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:55.980
SARA STEFANI: Oh.

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.007
IPads and iPhones?

00:43:57.007 --> 00:43:58.590
DAVID FERRIERO: Then
I said, you know,

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:00.150
the best part about
this technology

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:01.483
is it doesn't need your support.

00:44:01.483 --> 00:44:04.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:09.330
And the next call I got
was from acquisitions,

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:11.370
I understand you want
iPhones and iPads.

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:12.467
I say, isn't it exciting.

00:44:12.467 --> 00:44:13.800
We're going to be experimenting.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.367
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:14.367 --> 00:44:15.450
SARA STEFANI: I like this.

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:16.950
Just keep repeating it.

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:18.365
Yeah.

00:44:18.365 --> 00:44:19.990
DAVID FERRIERO:
That'll take 13 months.

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.750
13 months.

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:23.520
I said, no, that's
not good enough.

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.320
Uh-Uh, that doesn't work for me.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:29.340
SARA STEFANI: I
actually had a student--

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.110
I hope she's here today, but--

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:33.690
contact me yesterday
from the IDS

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.270
with the Indiana Daily Student,
which is a student newspaper.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:38.970
And she asked me a really
interesting question.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:43.350
She asked me what I found
most interesting or inspiring

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:44.190
about you.

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:48.760
And I have to say that
my answer was actually

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.670
the "Gighy" or
"Jiphy," depending

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:54.610
on how you pronounce it, the
Giphy Channel for the National

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:55.480
Archives.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.440
Because I checked it out.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.030
It's amazing.

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:02.350
There are 1,500 JIFs
or GIFs, depending

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:07.390
on your preference,
that have been uploaded

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:11.170
and over 5.3 billion views.

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:12.220
Billion.

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:16.780
And it's amazing because there
are things from World War One,

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.530
World War Two, but
also space exploration,

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:24.940
and the Apollo 11 mission,
and civil rights movement,

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.190
and women's suffrage.

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:31.630
But also kids
sledding, and holidays,

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:35.783
and my favorite, which is
the dancing dogs, Waffles

00:45:35.783 --> 00:45:36.325
and Dempsey--

00:45:36.325 --> 00:45:37.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.740
--who are wearing little tutus.

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:43.240
And what I said
was that, to me it

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:47.350
is making the federal government
and the National Archives

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:49.120
more accessible.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.290
And it is saying to
people, everyone's welcome.

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:58.450
We're not just this imposing
building on Pennsylvania Avenue

00:45:58.450 --> 00:45:59.800
but we're you.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.240
We're About you.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.970
So is this kind of
something that you felt--

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:08.830
how do you feel that this
helped with NARA's image?

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:10.840
DAVID FERRIERO: First of
all, it was unleashing

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:13.630
the talent within the
Agency that these folks have

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:16.570
been dreaming about things
to do with social media.

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:21.550
As I said, in 2009 we were not
on any social media platforms.

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:23.440
And the argument I
made with the staff

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.380
was, we are responsible
for providing

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:30.910
guidance to the agencies
about the records

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:34.130
implications of their
use of social media.

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:36.430
And if we're not using
this stuff ourselves,

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:38.930
how are we possibly
going to do that?

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:47.380
So we're now on 16 platforms
and the staff is energized,

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:51.370
and it has spread
to State Archives

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:55.792
and other archives have been
following what we're doing.

00:46:55.792 --> 00:46:57.250
SARA STEFANI: Well,
and I noticed--

00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:58.870
and we'll start
with the questions--

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:04.840
but I also noticed that the
Trump Presidential Library

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.638
has an archive of his tweets.

00:47:06.638 --> 00:47:07.930
DAVID FERRIERO: Yes, of course.

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:11.860
SARA STEFANI: So social
media is actually

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:15.010
an important social
phenomenon that

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:18.730
is woven into the nation's
history and the Presidential

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:20.350
Records.

00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:22.760
All right, so now we will
turn to y'all's questions.

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:27.010
So the first one for you
is, while we narrowly

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:30.700
avoided a government shutdown,
you saw the National Archives

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:32.590
through a few shutdowns.

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:38.920
How did these impact the work
of NARA, short and long term?

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.590
DAVID FERRIERO: It's
a horrible situation

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:45.970
because we have no idea how long
the shutdown is going to last.

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:49.490
That the staff by and large--

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:52.360
we have, for the National
Archives it's 3,000 people

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:57.370
in 42 facilities in 17 states--

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:59.830
most of them live
paycheck to paycheck.

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.650
They're not getting paid,
and they have no idea

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:05.290
how long this is going to last.

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.920
For the longer ones, and we've
been through some longer ones,

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:13.060
people have actually left
and taken other jobs.

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:18.430
But the damage it
does to people feeling

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:21.940
good about working for the
government and the damage

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:25.262
it does in recruiting
is really serious.

00:48:25.262 --> 00:48:27.220
SARA STEFANI: We talked
about this this morning

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:29.260
because my mother
actually worked

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:33.100
for the federal government for
the Department of Agriculture.

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:37.660
And she had to live
through several shutdowns

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:38.840
as a single mother.

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:41.650
And so I've
experienced this, so.

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:43.330
Yeah.

00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:45.550
What you're saying about
tarnishing kind of work--

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:47.300
anyway, all right.

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:47.900
Next question,

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:49.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.620
My students are currently
reading and thinking

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:52.670
about archives.

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:55.160
It's a history gateway
course but they

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:59.630
are deeply concerned about
access to historical materials.

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:03.560
What was your role in getting
materials into the archives

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:06.320
from various departments
of the government?

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:10.040


00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:14.200
DAVID FERRIERO: So way
back at the beginning,

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:18.310
when FDR signed the legislation
and created the National

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:20.380
Archives, he really
took-- as you

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.410
know I made that crack about
him being a closet archivist.

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:27.370
But he really took an
interest in the archives,

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:30.460
recruited the first
archivist, and made

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:34.930
sure that archivist got what
he needed in terms of support.

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:38.050
And that first archivist had
the job of wandering around town

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:39.760
and figuring out where
the records were,

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.520
and hiring a staff,
and an architect,

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.455
and all that kind of stuff.

00:49:44.455 --> 00:49:55.840


00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:56.980
Read that again.

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:58.185
SARA STEFANI: Oh, so.

00:49:58.185 --> 00:49:59.560
DAVID FERRIERO:
There was a point

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.550
I was trying to make with
[LAUGHS] why we had to go back.

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:04.810
Oh, because, OK.

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:08.680
So then this poor
archivist had the job

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:10.990
of convincing agency
heads that this

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:12.793
is the new way of doing
business and you've

00:50:12.793 --> 00:50:13.960
got to give me your records.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.910
And you can imagine
how that went over.

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:19.960
So FDR had to have a cabinet
meeting where he kind of laid

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.968
down the law about
this is the way we're

00:50:22.968 --> 00:50:24.010
going to do business now.

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:28.480
And the holdout then, and
to some extent still--

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.910
not that I want to throw
anyone under the bus--

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:31.600
SARA STEFANI: You're
retired, go ahead.

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:32.980
DAVID FERRIERO: --is
the State Department.

00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:33.688
SARA STEFANI: Oh.

00:50:33.688 --> 00:50:37.540
DAVID FERRIERO: So state
was a unhappy camper

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:40.720
at the very beginning, and
FDR took it upon himself

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.520
one evening after hours.

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:46.480
He wrote about this, and I
was in hysterics reading it.

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.360
He had himself taken over
to the State Department.

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:54.020
And he describes this long
corridor with filing cabinets.

00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:56.900
He wheels himself up
at random and pulls out

00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:03.170
a file on Mongolian ponies to
demonstrate that you perhaps

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:06.140
don't need this file
on Mongolian ponies

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:10.220
here in the State Department.

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.530
And that's been a
problem ever since.

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:16.730
That some agencies are--

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:20.210
especially, I would say
the intelligence community.

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.770
SARA STEFANI: Yeah.

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:25.580
Yeah, I guess I can
understand this reticence

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:28.070
when they're dealing with
intelligence and classified

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:28.770
documents.

00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:31.640
DAVID FERRIERO: So this
Mongolian Pony thing

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.700
bothered me.

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:36.950
And so I went to the staff
and said, so can you find it?

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:37.880
Do we have that?

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:38.660
We don't have it.

00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:39.500
We don't have it.

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:39.800
SARA STEFANI: Yeah

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.383
DAVID FERRIERO: So
they still have it.

00:51:41.383 --> 00:51:44.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:47.000
SARA STEFANI: Well, should
I submit a FOIA, Freedom

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.320
of Information Act request?

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.190
DAVID FERRIERO: That
would be fun, yeah.

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.898
SARA STEFANI: OK.

00:51:49.898 --> 00:51:50.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:55.280
How has the relationship between
historians and archivists

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.965
changed over the
course of your career?

00:51:57.965 --> 00:52:03.350


00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:07.960
DAVID FERRIERO: I think they
have better access to records

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:12.160
than they've had before.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:22.920
I think we're good salespeople
for their product, what

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:24.180
they've written.

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:30.480
I made it a point to do public
programs with any historian who

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.960
used the records as a way of
demonstrating the value that we

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:35.640
bring.

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.140
And I think the
work that we've been

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:39.810
doing in terms of
digitizing records

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:46.020
has improved the speed with
which they can do research.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.480
SARA STEFANI: And there's
actually a parenthetical

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:51.510
question here, where
the person says, here

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:55.770
at IU we collaborate more
as guardians of the past,

00:52:55.770 --> 00:53:02.160
navigating a more political
and less resourced present day.

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.390
DAVID FERRIERO: Interesting.

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:04.500
That's a good way
of phrasing it.

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:05.400
SARA STEFANI: Yeah.

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:09.690
So as Guardians of the past,
navigating a more political

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:12.180
and less resource present day.

00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:13.867
Did you feel that
when you were--

00:53:13.867 --> 00:53:14.950
DAVID FERRIERO: Definitely

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:15.430
SARA STEFANI: Yeah, archivist?

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:16.555
DAVID FERRIERO: Definitely.

00:53:16.555 --> 00:53:19.280


00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.860
SARA STEFANI: Next
one, can you speak

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:25.330
about archives in the age
of extreme climate change?

00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:25.840
Yeah.

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:29.230
How ready are American
archives for dealing

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:33.086
with natural disasters
and other kinds of things?

00:53:33.086 --> 00:53:34.120
DAVID FERRIERO: [SIGHS]

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:37.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.830
SARA STEFANI: I'm also
groaning inwardly, actually.

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:42.070
Yeah.

00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:43.900
DAVID FERRIERO:
It's a tough one.

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:47.275
How prepared are we?

00:53:47.275 --> 00:53:52.210
We have all kinds of
guidelines and stuff

00:53:52.210 --> 00:54:00.790
for natural disasters, but
when it hits, it's devastating.

00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:05.980
And we're so overtaxed in
terms of space for collections

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:09.700
that we make bargains
with the devil

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:14.390
about how we store stuff
and over-stuff places.

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:19.777


00:54:19.777 --> 00:54:21.360
And we're talking
about the originals,

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.360
and that's why every
digitization effort

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:28.140
is an opportunity to
preserve, to make sure

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:31.500
that the content is
available in another format,

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:34.800
in case there's some kind
of disaster like that.

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.140
SARA STEFANI: Yeah, and
also, I would add too

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:41.670
that there's not an equity,
in terms of resources,

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:43.470
to different archives.

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:46.290
The National Archives,
I'm assuming,

00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:52.230
has state of the art
facilities and conditions.

00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:56.520
Here at IU we have an amazing
auxiliary library facility

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.180
that has state of
the art conditions.

00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:02.490
But then you've got historical
societies and small archives

00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:07.290
in places where they
don't have that,

00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:11.790
and it's much more disastrous
when some kind of disaster

00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:13.290
hits, or a flood, or--

00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:14.400
DAVID FERRIERO: And
they're much more frequent,

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.025
those disasters are
much more frequent.

00:55:16.025 --> 00:55:19.720
SARA STEFANI: Yeah and they're
happening much more frequently.

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:23.010
So in a profession
that feels like we're

00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:27.570
frequently asked to do more
with less, in your career,

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:31.470
how have you advocated
for appropriate staffing

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:34.695
and resource levels to
support archival work?

00:55:34.695 --> 00:55:39.250


00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:44.350
DAVID FERRIERO: Ooh that's--
from the very beginning,

00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:46.750
archives aren't the
most important things

00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:53.140
in people's and funders'
minds, administration's minds.

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:54.430
Archives aren't sexy.

00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:57.430
Records aren't sexy.

00:55:57.430 --> 00:56:01.420
So there has to be
some kind of link

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:08.290
to some initiative that
makes sense for the funding

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:10.690
opportunity.

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:14.770
Private foundations,
if you can demonstrate

00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:17.680
that you have something
that's of value

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:21.200
to a private foundation,
at least in my experience,

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:25.570
that sends a signal
to the administration

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:29.020
funders that perhaps--

00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:33.760
if there's a requirement
for a matching gift--

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:37.630
that this is an opportunity to
support something and create

00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:41.623
something great that
distinguishes the institution.

00:56:41.623 --> 00:56:43.040
We're always looking
for something

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:48.620
that would impress the funders,
the administration, that

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:52.970
would raise the profile
of the institution.

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:56.660
SARA STEFANI: Can I
ask a related question.

00:56:56.660 --> 00:57:00.110
So I'm assuming that most of
the funding of the National

00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:04.100
Archives comes from
Congress from appropriations

00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:05.480
bills and et cetera.

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.958
Does it cover all of the funding
for the National Archives?

00:57:07.958 --> 00:57:10.250
DAVID FERRIERO: No, we have
a private foundation, also,

00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:11.210
that raises money.

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:14.240
And all the education
programs, exhibits,

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:17.900
are funded by the
private foundation.

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:20.990
And the Presidential Libraries
have private foundations also.

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:25.460
And they fund, depending
upon the library,

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:27.380
various aspects of the work.

00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:28.250
SARA STEFANI: OK.

00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:31.460
DAVID FERRIERO:
But the government

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:35.000
work of maintaining
the records, that's

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.500
paid for by the government.

00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:38.090
SARA STEFANI: OK.

00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:41.260
What is the process
for requesting access

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:44.418
to restricted materials?

00:57:44.418 --> 00:57:46.960
DAVID FERRIERO: It depends on
what the restricted material is

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:51.460
and what the requirements
are for access.

00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:54.850
You can file a FOIA request.

00:57:54.850 --> 00:58:02.320
And one of the ways to expedite
that FOIA request, if you're

00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.360
having trouble with
your FOIA request,

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:08.530
there is a little
known organization

00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:11.290
unit within the
National Archives

00:58:11.290 --> 00:58:13.863
called the Office of Government
Information Services--

00:58:13.863 --> 00:58:15.530
SARA STEFANI: I have
to write that down.

00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:17.800
DAVID FERRIERO: --which
is the FOIA ombudsman,

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:24.020
which serves to facilitate
access for the American public.

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:28.300
So if you're having
trouble with the FBI

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:31.930
and having your
request honored, you

00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:38.330
can work with my staff
and OTIS to expedite it.

00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:39.590
SARA STEFANI: OK.

00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:40.940
Can I ask a related question--

00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:44.210
DAVID FERRIERO: All of the FOIA
folks in all of the agencies,

00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:46.340
and I can tell you this
from personal experience,

00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:47.810
are overworked.

00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:50.580
There aren't enough people
handling FOIA requests.

00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:52.280
It's a huge problem

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:57.380
SARA STEFANI: Yeah, I recently
attended an online forum

00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:00.440
on the mandatory
declassification review

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:05.840
process, and they said something
like, the vast majority of FOIA

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:11.450
requests come from only a
very small number of agencies

00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:12.590
or people, essentially.

00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:15.980
And that they make so many
requests that it clogs up

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.680
the system a lot.

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.300
And then a related
question to that

00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:23.900
too and along the lines
of what I just asked,

00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:27.772
is restricted materials but
also classified materials--

00:59:27.772 --> 00:59:28.730
DAVID FERRIERO: [GASPS]

00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:30.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:35.160
SARA STEFANI: Because you
said, with sunshine week,

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:37.410
the open government
celebration, you

00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:41.850
mentioned that the whole
point of the open government

00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:45.480
is transparency and avoiding
unnecessary secrecy.

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:49.680
But I think several people
think of classification

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:53.070
and classified documents as
that unnecessary secrecy.

00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:55.740
So who decides if
it's classified

00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:57.020
and how do you declassify it?

00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:58.800
DAVID FERRIERO:
It's a real issue.

00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.950
Another little known unit
within the National Archives

01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:04.290
is the Information
Security Oversight Office,

01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:06.270
which has responsibility
for overseeing

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:09.360
all the classification
activity, monitoring it.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:15.210
And I can tell you that we
have a huge over classification

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:19.260
problem within the government
in the executive branch.

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:25.740
We now have in the neighborhood
of 2,500 original classifiers.

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:28.230
These are folks who are
authorized to classify.

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:32.880
This is down from about
9,500 when I started in 2009.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.610
So we've narrowed
the number of folks

01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:38.910
who have the responsibility
or have the ability.

01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:43.710
There are no standards
among those 2,500 people

01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:46.500
about what is top
secret and what

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.320
might not be classified at all.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:52.170
Unlike other countries
who have carved out what

01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:55.650
it means for each of the
classification areas.

01:00:55.650 --> 01:01:00.480
It's coupled with the fact
that the classification process

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.410
is pretty tedious.

01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:05.010
It's line by line,
determining whether it really

01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:06.600
needs to be classified or not.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.570
And it's easier just to
classify the whole damn document

01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:13.170
than to do that line by line.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:18.220
And there was one more piece
of it, of the declassification.

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.163
SARA STEFANI: Yeah,
I mean, that is also

01:01:20.163 --> 01:01:21.580
DAVID FERRIERO:
Regardless of what

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.530
you may have read
in the press, it's

01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:26.810
about magic and
waving a magic wand.

01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:28.990
There is a
declassification process.

01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:32.600
Oh, I know what I was going to
say on the classification side.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.540
Especially in the
intelligence community,

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:38.590
there are multiple agencies
that have equity in a document.

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:42.220
So the classification
may have different levels

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:45.440
of classification within
the same document.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.610
So that relates to
declassification also.

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:52.930
So while the president does have
the authority to declassify,

01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:55.220
there is a process
that is followed,

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.970
so that the agencies who did
the original classification

01:01:57.970 --> 01:01:59.192
are notified--

01:01:59.192 --> 01:02:00.400
SARA STEFANI: And can object.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.140
DAVID FERRIERO: --because
that's not the only copy.

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.110
Oh, they can object.

01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:06.670
[LAUGHS] That's
not the only copy

01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:08.050
that sits in the White House.

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:10.510
The agencies that did the
original classification,

01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:11.710
they have copies also.

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:14.290
So it's very important
that the agencies

01:02:14.290 --> 01:02:17.750
be notified that that
has been declassified.

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:20.330
SARA STEFANI: And if I
understand this correctly,

01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:25.520
one document can also
have the State Department

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.270
has classified--

01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:27.140
DAVID FERRIERO:
Multiple equities.

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:27.890
Yeah, exactly.

01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:31.370
SARA STEFANI: --the CIA
has classified part,

01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:33.750
the National Security Agency
has done a different--

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.810
So and all of
those agencies have

01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:39.590
to declassify that particular
portion that they originally

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:40.270
classified.

01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:40.820
DAVID FERRIERO: Yep.

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:41.150
SARA STEFANI: Is that?

01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.690
DAVID FERRIERO: That's it.

01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:42.690
That's the way it works.

01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:44.030
SARA STEFANI: Yeah, no.

01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:44.930
Easy-peasy.

01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:46.070
All right.

01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:49.430
Your undergraduate degree
is in English literature.

01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:52.400
Can you speak to how that
degree or course of study

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.310
influenced your career,
if it did at all,

01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:58.910
and/or the broader role of
education in the humanities

01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:01.700
in preparing people for
careers in information and/or

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:04.790
public service.

01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:07.700
DAVID FERRIERO: I was
originally an education major.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:12.350
I always thought I was going
to teach when I first went

01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:14.030
to Northeastern University.

01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:20.970
And the education
courses were just so bad

01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:22.763
that I dropped out of school.

01:03:22.763 --> 01:03:23.430
SARA STEFANI: Oh

01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:24.305
DAVID FERRIERO: Yeah.

01:03:24.305 --> 01:03:26.490
I Joined the Navy,
and when I came back,

01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:30.330
I was a liberal arts major and
had very different attitude

01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:31.590
toward higher education.

01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:35.700
And took courses that
were meaningful to me

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.760
and a wide range across
history, and literature,

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.640
and political science,
and psychology.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.540
And it was a well rounded
education which, I think,

01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:49.870
gave me an important basis
for higher education,

01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:52.530
but also thinking about careers.

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:57.450
And at the same time I was
working in my co-op position

01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:01.230
as a junior library
assistant in the libraries

01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:05.100
at MIT, which exposed me to
all kinds of opportunities

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.240
about library work.

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.020
So it was the
combination of the two,

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:11.287
I think, that put
me where I am today.

01:04:11.287 --> 01:04:12.370
SARA STEFANI: I like that.

01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:16.890
So you went from a junior
library position to working--

01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:18.640
DAVID FERRIERO: They
knew they had someone

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.320
on the hook when I came.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.960
Because I just volunteered
to do anything.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.560
For those of you
who are old enough

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:32.230
to remember filing in the shelf
list, I was allowed to file--

01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:34.600
me, a [INAUDIBLE]
student, was allowed

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.950
to file in the
Southwest above the rod.

01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:42.520
Which means that someone,
a real professional,

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.800
came behind me and checked
my work to pull the rod

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.950
and drop the cart.

01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:47.980
So I wasn't doing
the filing, actually.

01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:49.120
SARA STEFANI: Oh, I see.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.050
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:50.050 --> 01:04:55.810
But you went from that to MIT,
and Duke, and the New York

01:04:55.810 --> 01:04:59.563
Public Library, and the
Archivist of the United States.

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:00.730
DAVID FERRIERO: That's right

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:01.150
SARA STEFANI: Yeah.

01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:01.983
DAVID FERRIERO: Hmm.

01:05:01.983 --> 01:05:03.250
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:04.510
SARA STEFANI: Amazing.

01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:08.830
How do you view the new trend
of increased book banning

01:05:08.830 --> 01:05:12.310
and censorship, and
in what ways could it

01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:16.928
affect how our public
records are maintained?

01:05:16.928 --> 01:05:18.470
DAVID FERRIERO: It's
a good question.

01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:21.850
I think that it's just
a horrible situation.

01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:28.140
And I feel badly for
especially school librarians,

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:31.680
who are the targets
of a lot of this--

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:35.640
and some public
librarians, also.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.266
It's hard for me to imagine.

01:05:38.266 --> 01:05:39.630
No, I guess it's not hard.

01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:41.580
Anything, anything can happen.

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:45.690
In terms of the
way records might

01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:50.760
be influenced, the way the
process works is that there

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.210
are records managers
in each of the agencies

01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:57.360
who are responsible
for overseeing

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.120
all the regulations about
creation and maintenance

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.300
of records.

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:07.320
So these are career
civil servants.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:12.520
They report, however,
to their agencies.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.400
It's something that
has bothered me,

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.950
and in fact, I made
recommendations

01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:20.010
that all of the
records folks should

01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:21.330
be reporting to the archives.

01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:24.510


01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:28.480
Like the model that's used for
the Inspector General community

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.250
within the federal government.

01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:33.040
They sit in the
agencies, but they

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:38.650
report to a central
Inspector General Agency.

01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:43.240
There has been, and I can point
to several examples of bias

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:47.860
in record keeping
in various agencies.

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:51.100
Because of the
presidential appointment

01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:57.850
at the head of the Agency hiding
information or withholding

01:06:57.850 --> 01:06:58.850
information.

01:06:58.850 --> 01:07:01.760
And in some cases
changing information.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.410
So those are things
that would be addressed.

01:07:05.410 --> 01:07:07.690
I think if that
records manager was

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.520
more comfortable in
reporting it out.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:10.795
SARA STEFANI: Right, and
had some accountability.

01:07:10.795 --> 01:07:11.795
DAVID FERRIERO: Exactly.

01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:14.440
SARA STEFANI: And
somebody who could

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:18.010
notice that and correct it.

01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:21.700
In terms of preservation,
while it is currently

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:24.250
out of the capacity
for any authority

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:26.740
to store absolutely
everything, do

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:30.400
you think private corporations
have a responsibility

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.322
to preserve?

01:07:33.322 --> 01:07:36.575
DAVID FERRIERO: Preserve their
own records, or preserve what?

01:07:36.575 --> 01:07:37.950
SARA STEFANI: So
I will continue.

01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:38.310
DAVID FERRIERO: Oh.

01:07:38.310 --> 01:07:38.850
[LAUGHS]

01:07:38.850 --> 01:07:41.790
SARA STEFANI: Do you think that
a website such as YouTube, one

01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:44.880
full of audio books, news
reports, historical footage,

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:49.170
rare media, tutorials, cultural
touchstones, et cetera,

01:07:49.170 --> 01:07:52.950
has a responsibility to
maintain these archives,

01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:54.870
as they have inserted
themselves as such

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:57.365
an important feature of the
modern world in other ways?

01:07:57.365 --> 01:07:58.990
DAVID FERRIERO: That's
a good question.

01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:00.008
SARA STEFANI: That
is a good one.

01:08:00.008 --> 01:08:00.883
DAVID FERRIERO: Yeah.

01:08:00.883 --> 01:08:03.430


01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:04.120
Sure.

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:04.773
Yes.

01:08:04.773 --> 01:08:05.440
SARA STEFANI: OK

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.395
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:06.395 --> 01:08:08.020
DAVID FERRIERO: Let's
make that happen.

01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:08.950
SARA STEFANI: OK.

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:10.210
I like it.

01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:12.670
I mean, Yeah.

01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:17.319
I mean, I'm sort of struck,
and the details are fuzzy,

01:08:17.319 --> 01:08:21.910
but I know that there was an
incident not long ago where--

01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:24.910
I think it was
maybe in Ukraine--

01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:29.140
but somebody had posted
something and then immediately

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.189
taken it down.

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:32.859
But it was still in
the internet archives,

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:37.300
and that was the only place that
had whatever this statement was

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:40.359
or this document that was
put up online and immediately

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:41.810
taken down.

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:49.064
So I think this question of,
you have things on YouTube

01:08:49.064 --> 01:08:51.729
and whether they have
that responsibility

01:08:51.729 --> 01:08:53.689
as part of the record
is an interesting one.

01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:55.210
So.

01:08:55.210 --> 01:08:55.848
All right--

01:08:55.848 --> 01:08:57.640
DAVID FERRIERO: Can I
just share two things

01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.511
that I brought this
notebook to share.

01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:00.220
SARA STEFANI: Oh.

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.303
DAVID FERRIERO: This thing
about access to records

01:09:02.303 --> 01:09:03.399
is something that--

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:06.010
it wasn't until 1934
that legislation

01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:08.229
was signed to create
the National Archives,

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:11.410
but the worry about
access to records

01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:14.020
goes way back to
the very beginning.

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:19.450
And I got two letters from
Thomas Jefferson on this topic.

01:09:19.450 --> 01:09:22.870
In 1789, he wrote
that, "Whenever

01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:24.640
the people are
well informed, they

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.470
can be trusted with
their own government.

01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:28.779
That whenever things
go so far wrong

01:09:28.779 --> 01:09:32.020
as to attract their notice,
they may be relied on

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:33.790
to set them to rights."

01:09:33.790 --> 01:09:37.029
And then in 1791.

01:09:37.029 --> 01:09:38.140
That was 1789.

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:42.430
In 1791 he said, "Time and
accident are committing

01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:45.910
daily havoc on the valuable
historical and state papers

01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:47.740
you have--

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:48.460
I'm sorry.

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.740
"Time and accident are
committing daily havoc

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:53.710
on the originals deposited
in our public offices.

01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:57.460
The late war has done the work
of centuries in this business.

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:59.240
The lost cannot be recovered.

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:03.520
But let us save what remains,
not by vaults and locks which

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.780
fence them from the
public eye and use

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:08.190
and consigning them
to the waste of time.

01:10:08.190 --> 01:10:11.210
But by such multiplication
of copies as

01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:13.850
shall place them beyond
the reach of accident."

01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:15.890
Multiplication of copies.

01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:18.935
He is the grandfather
of my digitization work.

01:10:18.935 --> 01:10:20.110
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:21.590
Multiplication of copies.

01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:24.410
And then Franklin Roosevelt,
when he was dedicating

01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:27.650
the Presidential Library said--

01:10:27.650 --> 01:10:30.350
he dedicated the
dedication of the library

01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:31.790
as an act of faith--

01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:33.837
"To bring together the
records of the past

01:10:33.837 --> 01:10:35.420
and to house them
into buildings where

01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:37.610
they will be preserved for
the use of men and women

01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:38.570
in the future.

01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:40.700
A nation must believe
in three things.

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:42.110
It must believe in the past.

01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:44.010
It must believe in the future.

01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:47.730
It must, above all, believe in
the capacity of its own people.

01:10:47.730 --> 01:10:50.960
So to learn from the past
that they can gain in judgment

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:53.010
in creating their own future."

01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:55.594
So that's what it's all about.

01:10:55.594 --> 01:10:59.490
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:59.490 --> 01:11:07.300


01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:08.890
DINA KELLAMS: That
was so wonderful.

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:11.140
Sarah, thank you so much.

01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:13.710
On behalf of the Indiana
University Archives,

01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:15.400
and the Indiana
University Libraries,

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.530
and all of our
partners, I just want

01:11:17.530 --> 01:11:19.910
to thank everybody who
made this event possible.

01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:22.630
Particularly the IU
library staff members,

01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:26.140
who work behind the scenes
to ensure that everything

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:28.150
runs like a well-oiled machine.

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:31.870
It's amazing to have colleagues
who welcome your ideas

01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:34.480
and figure out how they
can help them succeed.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.090
Thank you to Dr. Sara
Stefani for serving

01:11:37.090 --> 01:11:41.470
as our very capable and very
informed moderator tonight.

01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:42.580
This is how old I am.

01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:45.070
I'm ready to go to bed already.

01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:46.880
And Thank you all for attending.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.430
And Thank you,
David, for joining us

01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:51.280
at Indiana University this week.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.500
The libraries would
like to send you home

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:57.220
with one of our most popular
Indiana University Press books.

01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:00.100
However, this will put you
over your weight limit.

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:01.570
So we will mail it to you.

01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:03.200
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.930
And with that, we will
conclude today's event.

01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:07.760
Thank you, everybody,
for coming today.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:11.110
[APPLAUSE]
